# Tensor Phone

Tensor Phone is an independent hardware initiative developing a minimalist smartphone that brings modern connectivity without digital overload.  
Built on a stripped Android base, it focuses on essential tools—calls, messages, music, maps—while removing social media and overstimulating apps.

## Mission
To make a phone that helps people live intentionally by merging calm design with full technical capability.

## Key Goals
- 4.6” monochrome display for relaxed visuals  
- Full 5G, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, and GPS  
- Runs Android (no Google bloat, no games)  
- Supports WhatsApp, SMS, and basic utilities  
- Unlocked for major carriers
